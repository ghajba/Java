This folder contains a simple XSD validation program which takes .xml and .xsd files as parameter 
and validates each XML file against all the XSD files.

Should be working with any Java version >= 5, I tested it with Java 7 and Java 6

The extended version is located at: http://hahamo.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/validating-xml-against-xsd/

Usage:
java XSDValidator <list of XML files> <list of XSD files>
